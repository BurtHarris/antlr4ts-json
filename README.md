antlr4ts - Yet another json parser
==================================

Why: This project is a tutorial for using the [Antlr4](http://www.antlr.org/) parser generator on  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) using the [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and serve as a walkthrough of best practices for the NPM module [antlr4ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antlr4ts).

This is _not_ a tutorial on the Antlr4 language, it's intended to illustrate use the node.js targeted `antlr4ts.   

It may evolve into a useful npm module as well, but until antlr4ts becomes stable, that's stretching it.

**[The walkthrough starts here](docs/README)**
